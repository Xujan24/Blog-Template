## Responsive Blog Template using CSS ONLY
EESSLA is a simple and responsive blog template, created using `CSS Grid`. This project is intended for those people who are interested in responsive web design. I have also included the `SCSS` files so that you can download the project and play around with it. <br />
The code for the responsive menu, used in this project, is taken from [Mike's Magic Mobile Mega Menu](https://codepen.io/tiffachoo/pen/yzZRXK). This project also uses google fonts and Font Awesome for icons.
